Loss Functions for Seg-only Registration

Composite (sum of weighted terms; weights live in config.yaml -> loss):

    Segmentation alignment
      - dice (excludes background channel 0)
      - cross_entropy (vs argmax of one-hot target)

    Geometric regularization
      - bending energy (second-order smoothness)
      - Jacobian determinant (linear-neg + top-K + pre-fold barrier;
        bulk-mean ReLU(-det) was found insufficient to suppress fold voxels)
      - displacement magnitude

    Lambda-based adaptive regularization (linear-λ + anatomy prior)
      - lambda_weighted_smoothness:  mean( λ_avg · |∇φ|² )       [linear in λ]
      - lambda_prior:                anatomy-aware Gaussian pulling λ toward
                                     (1 - dilated_boundary(sample_seg))

    Distillation regression (only active when pred_vel/target_vel are passed)
      - vel_mse: MSE against the per-subject band-limited "combo" velocity

    Surface distance (only active when `surf` is passed)
      - surface, surface_tail: mm distance between the deformed white
        surfaces and the precomputed signed-distance volumes, both directions

    Mesh regularisers (only active when `surf` carries 'mesh')
      - mesh_edge, mesh_lap, mesh_normal: distortion of the full pushed
        template mesh in excess of the affine-aligned template's own

    (No cycle term — single-SVF model makes the inverse exact; see
    cycle_consistency_loss, kept only as a diagnostic.)

    Affine regularization (only active when affine_matrix is not None)
      - affine_reg:   MSE against the 3x4 identity affine
      - affine_ortho: MSE of RᵀR vs I on the rotation submatrix

Notes:
- The lambda formulations were rewritten after the test_1 baseline collapsed
  to a constant λ ≈ 0.5 over 70 epochs (see dump/2026-05-28_pre-R1/). The
  linear-λ smoothness gives the head a data-dependent gradient; the
  anatomy-aware prior gives it a meaningful target. Together they are the
  minimum change required to break collapse — neither alone is sufficient.
- The Jacobian formulation is the current top-K + pre-fold one, calibrated
  with config weight 0.5 (not the original 0.01 on plain mean(ReLU(-det))).

# Lambda-based Adaptive Regularization (linear-λ + anatomy prior)
# =============================================================================
#
# History: the original (test_1) formulations were *quadratic in λ* with a
# constant-0.5 Gaussian prior (σ=0.1). Visualisation of a 70-epoch run
# (see dump/2026-05-28_pre-R1/) confirmed total collapse — global std of λ
# ≈ 0.003, r(λ, |∇φ|) ≈ 0 with the wrong sign on the worst-folding subjects.
# Two coupled root causes:
#   1. Quadratic-in-λ smoothness has ∂L/∂λ ∝ λ — gradient vanishes precisely
#      at the constant-0.5 equilibrium the prior pins it to.
#   2. The constant-0.5 prior with σ=0.1 has effective coefficient
#      0.05·1/(2·0.01) = 2.5 on (λ−0.5)² — far larger than any λ-dependent
#      term it competes with at init.
#
# The two functions below address both: linear-in-λ smoothness gives the
# head a data-dependent gradient, and an anatomy-derived prior gives it a
# meaningful target instead of a degenerate constant.
